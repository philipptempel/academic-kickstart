 abstract = {Multi-stage production systems concede for low error and failure margins within every single machining and assembly step to not degrade product quality. Especially during multi-stage production of rotating parts, minor defects during a single step can corrupt a workpiece beyond repair. Since multistage production systems are complex, inter-connected chains of machining steps, a global approach to handling and compensating error emergence and propagation is for reaching Zero-Defect Manufacturing indispensable. We introduce Part Variation Modeling within a knowledge capturing platform to monitor centrally gathered metrological data for deviations. Further, a parametric model is presented allowing for description of rotating parts and enabling identification of deviations at every stage. Based on our inter-stage correlation analysis technique, the parametric model enables description of Part Variation Modes of a piece given current machine states and historic deviation likelihood as will be presented.}

 abstract = {For the assessment of small airway diseases, a noninvasive double-tracer gas single-breath washout (DTG-SBW) with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and helium (He) as tracer components has been proposed. It is assumed that small airway diseases may produce typical ventilation inhomogeneities which can be detected within one single tidal breath, when using two tracer components. Characteristic parameters calculated from a relative molar mass (MM) signal of the airflow during the washout expiration phase are analyzed. The DTG-SBW signal is acquired by subtracting a reconstructed MM signal without tracer gas from the signal measured with an ultrasonic sensor during in- and exhalation of the double-tracer gas for one tidal breath. In this paper, a simple method to determine the reconstructed MM signal is presented. Measurements on subjects with and without obstructive lung diseases including the small airways have shown high reliability and reproducibility of this method.}

Solutions to the forward kinematics problem are computed by minimizing potential energy in the cable robot. As shown in this paper, the method unifies forward kinematics of both over-constrained and under-constrained cable robots.}

 abstract = {Comparing cable-driven parallel robots (short CDPRs or cable robots) with conventional parallel mechanisms, CDPRs have advantages in terms of flexibility, dynamics, and workspace size. In general, the rotational capabilities of parallel mechanisms without any additional actuator system are limited. This paper presents an approach for the design and analysis of a CDPR which allows an unlimited rotation about one axis by actuating solely cables. The unlimited rotation consists of a relative positioning between multiple platforms. The kinematics, static force distribution, and the workspace of a planar cable robot are analyzed. A formulation of the structure matrix for cable robots with multiple platforms is given, allowing to use conventional algorithms for calculation of force distributions. The performed simulation shows different characteristics of the force distribution and workspace of this new type of cable robot contrary to conventional ones. Finally, the conclusion shows that the dextrous workspaces of the investigated CDPR is nonempty.}

 abstract = {Cable-driven parallel robots are a special kind of parallel mechanism which use cables instead of rigid prismatic actuators to control a single platform. This paper presents a modeling approach to replace the single platform by multiple platforms. With this approach, it is possible to perform unlimited rotation with cable robots end-effector by relatively positioning these multiple platforms. We show how this class of cable robots can be modeled as multibody system, where platforms are connected with linkages by using revolute joints. These linkages can be seen as coupling elements. For example, using a crankshaft as coupling element, cable robots can perform novel motions such as unlimited rotation. We find a generic approach describing such multi-platform cable robot systems, after which force distribution and workspace of a case study are analyzed. Finally, we find out that inclusion and total orientation workspace are nonempty, considering joint reaction forces and platform and linkage masses. Furthermore, our modeling approach can be used for spatial multi-platform cable robots with revolute joints.}

 abstract = {During manufacturing, geometrical deviations occur, e.g. due to heating processes. In multi-stage production systems, these errors propagate and lead to expensive rework or, even, to unusable products. In this paper, a method for smart centering of rotation-symmetric parts is introduced. The method is used in the scope of achieving zero-defect manufacturing processes. For this purpose, the products are measured and automatically compared with the required specifications. Based on the identified deviations, process parameters can be adapted and thus, defects can be compensated in downstream production steps. The method is exemplified in the context of an industrial use case.}

Unfortunately, not all of these values can be determined analytically nor can they be obtained from simple measurements. Established experiments for inertial parameters estimation have been applied to serial and parallel rigid-link manipulators, yet in very few cases to cable-driven parallel robots. Due to their kinematic properties and their unique setup, cable robots are more sensitive to incorrect estimates of the inertial parameters making it important to obtain such quantities through experiments. In this work, we assess the topic of inertial parameter identification of a parallel flexible-link manipulator exemplified by the suspended cable-driven parallel robot COGIRO. Identification equations are derived from Newton-Euler equations of motion of an arbitrary point fixed to a rigid-body. Laboratory experiments for identification of the inertial parameters are then introduced and results are presented. Within the limitations of the sensors and data acquisition methods, reasonable results have been obtained, thereby validating the procedure for suspended cabledriven parallel robots.}

 abstract = {Cable-driven parallel robots are a special class of parallel manipulators with prismatic rigid-link actuators replaced by flexible and elastic fiber cables. However, this in nature simple replacement of motion and force transmitting components, results in drastic implications on the kinematics and dynamics of such robots. Not only are cables noticeably lighter than their rigid-link counterparts, but they are also more elastic and flexible which becomes very apparent when spanning a cable between two points: cable sag is induced by the cable's own weight, a behavior that cannot be compensated for completely. Incommodiously, these two properties---elasticity and flexibility---of fiber cables makes operating cable-driven parallel robots more involved than anticipated from their rigidlink counterparts and is still an active research field. In this thesis, particular focus is placed on the dynamics of cable-driven parallel robots under explicit consideration of cables and their spatial and axial dynamics.

For the purpose of designing and controlling cable robots, we derive a full multibody model of cable robots describing spatial cable motion by means of Cosserat rod theory. Borrowed from classical mechanics, Cosserat rods capture large elastic deformations such as strain and bending allowing for describing motion of cables in space. The equations of motion are discretized using Rayleigh-Ritz's approach to turn the continuum ``cable'' into a finite-dimensional model. Reference for evaluation of the cable and robot model are classical beam theory much like well-established methods of cable robot kinetostatics and of cable force distribution calculations. Numerical results of the robot dynamics are obtained with an energy and momentum conserving mechanical integrator for constrained multibody systems.

Axial stress-strain dynamics of fiber cables show hysteretic and nonlinear behavior which cannot be represented by a purely linear spring. We propose theoretically and investigate experimentally an analogous model based on multiple springs and dampers, that captures hysteretic behavior and stress relaxation well. Its elastic and viscous material parameters are estimated using transfer function identification.

Both contributions provide valid models for further considerations in modeling, simulation, and control of cable-driven parallel robots.}

Numerical time integration of the dynamics is performed using an energy-momentum conserving integration scheme.

The stress-strain dynamics of such cables are highly non-linear with time-varying mechanical parameters, resulting in involved modeling and control of robot dynamics. To improve controllability of cable robots, the cable stress-strain dynamics need to be known and explicitly considered feedforward or closed-loop control. A model can only be deemed suitable, if its inherent dynamics is confirmed through experiments and if it allows for reasonable parameter estimation. We present results of experimental identification of stress-strain dynamics of UHMWPE cables made of Dyneema in different stages of operation. Due to the internal material mechanics, four stages can be identified: the tensing and relaxing transition as well as plateaus coming from either. The implications of verified and parametrized stress-strain models for cable robot tension control strategies is expedited.}
