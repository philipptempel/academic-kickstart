abstract: >
    Cable-driven parallel robots make use of elastic cables for force and motion transmission from the driving winches to the mobile platform.
    The system is inherently susceptible to transversal cable vibration stemming from jerky motion of the platform as well as cable winding and guiding.
    To improve precision and stiffness of cable robots, the cable motion must explicitly be considered in simulation and control.
    In this talk, we present different approaches to modeling the cable shape based on the static model first derived by Irvine.
    Two main approaches will be presented, one based on discretization of the cable into segments yielding high dimensional systems, the other being based on Rayleigh-Ritz modal superposition yielding lower dimensional systems.
    Additionally, the static and dynamic cable force transmission is evaluated against existing models such as four-element or Flory models.
    Furthermore, overall model validity and applicability to improving accuracy and stiffness is shown.
