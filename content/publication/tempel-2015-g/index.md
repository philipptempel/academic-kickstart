abstract: >
  In the German Pavilion at the EXPO 2015, two large cable-driven parallel
  robots are flying over the heads of the visitors representing two bees flying over
  Germany and displaying everyday life in Germany. Each robot consists of a mobile
  platform and eight cables suspended by winches and follows a desired trajectory,
  which needs to be computed in advance taking technical limitations, safety considerations
  and visual aspects into account. In this paper, a path planning software is presented,
  which includes the design process from developing a robot design and workspace estimation
  via planning complex trajectories considering technical limitations through to exporting
  a complete show. For a test trajectory, simulation results are given, which display
  the relevant trajectories and cable force distributions.
