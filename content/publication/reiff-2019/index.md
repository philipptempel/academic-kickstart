abstract: >
  During manufacturing, geometrical deviations occur, e.g. due to heating
  processes. In multi-stage production systems, these errors propagate and lead to
  expensive rework or, even, to unusable products. In this paper, a method for smart
  centering of rotation-symmetric parts is introduced. The method is used in the scope
  of achieving zero-defect manufacturing processes. For this purpose, the products
  are measured and automatically compared with the required specifications. Based
  on the identified deviations, process parameters can be adapted and thus, defects
  can be compensated in downstream production steps. The method is exemplified in
  the context of an industrial use case.
