abstract: For the assessment of small airway diseases, a noninvasive double-tracer
  gas single-breath washout (DTG-SBW) with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and helium (He)
  as tracer components has been proposed. It is assumed that small airway diseases
  may produce typical ventilation inhomogeneities which can be detected within one
  single tidal breath, when using two tracer components. Characteristic parameters
  calculated from a relative molar mass (MM) signal of the airflow during the washout
  expiration phase are analyzed. The DTG-SBW signal is acquired by subtracting a reconstructed
  MM signal without tracer gas from the signal measured with an ultrasonic sensor
  during in- and exhalation of the double-tracer gas for one tidal breath. In this
  paper, a simple method to determine the reconstructed MM signal is presented. Measurements
  on subjects with and without obstructive lung diseases including the small airways
  have shown high reliability and reproducibility of this method.
