abstract: Additive manufacturing has attracted a lot of attention in the recent years
  as it allows to effectively manufacture objects with complex shape in batch size
  one. Extrusion-based additive processes employ manipulators, such as robots, to
  move the printing head along a predefined path. This paper deals with the design,
  implementation, and experimental evaluation of a new cable-driven parallel robot
  for additive manufacturing called CaRo printer. We compare the proposed robot structure
  with other cable robots and present technical details of the evaluation. Technical
  details on the mechanical and controller design are given. A special focus is laid
  on practical aspects and observations made from long-term operation of the demonstrator.
  We present measured data from the long-term operation at the exhibition.
