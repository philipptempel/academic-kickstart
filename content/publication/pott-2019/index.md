abstract: This paper deals with a unified approach to forward kinematics for both
  over-constrained and under-constrained cable robots. Moreover, little assumptions
  on the cable model are required. This makes the proposed method applicable to a
  variety of currently discussed cable models including the standard model, an elastic
  cable model, static cable sagging, or even finite elements model. Solutions to the
  forward kinematics problem are computed by minimizing potential energy in the cable
  robot. As shown in this paper, the method unifies forward kinematics of both over-constrained
  and under-constrained cable robots.
