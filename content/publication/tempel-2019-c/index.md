abstract: 'Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene fibers like Dyneema or Spectra
  are employed in a vast variety of cable-driven parallel robots. The stress-strain
  dynamics of such cables are highly non-linear with time-varying mechanical parameters,
  resulting in involved modeling and control of robot dynamics. To improve controllability
  of cable robots, the cable stress-strain dynamics need to be known and explicitly
  considered feedforward or closed-loop control. A model can only be deemed suitable,
  if its inherent dynamics is confirmed through experiments and if it allows for reasonable
  parameter estimation. We present results of experimental identification of stress-strain
  dynamics of UHMWPE cables made of Dyneema in different stages of operation. Due
  to the internal material mechanics, four stages can be identified: the tensing and
  relaxing transition as well as plateaus coming from either. The implications of
  verified and parametrized stress-strain models for cable robot tension control strategies
  is expedited.'
