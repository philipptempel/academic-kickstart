  Comparing cable-driven parallel robots (short CDPRs or cable robots) with
  conventional parallel mechanisms, CDPRs have advantages in terms of flexibility,
  dynamics, and workspace size. In general, the rotational capabilities of parallel
  mechanisms without any additional actuator system are limited. This paper presents
  an approach for the design and analysis of a CDPR which allows an unlimited rotation
  about one axis by actuating solely cables. The unlimited rotation consists of a
  relative positioning between multiple platforms. The kinematics, static force distribution,
  and the workspace of a planar cable robot are analyzed. A formulation of the structure
  matrix for cable robots with multiple platforms is given, allowing to use conventional
  algorithms for calculation of force distributions. The performed simulation shows
  different characteristics of the force distribution and workspace of this new type
  of cable robot contrary to conventional ones. Finally, the conclusion shows that
  the dextrous workspaces of the investigated CDPR is nonempty.
