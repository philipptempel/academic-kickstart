abstract: "Cables, such as these used to drive a cable-driven parallel robot's platform, are therein generally considered massless, straight lines between two points neglecting major dynamics. This assumption holds true for some cable robots, however for others, the effects on the platform's behavior due to cables having mass cannot be neglected. It is a challenging question to investigate the impact of a comprehensive detailed cable model on the performance of cabledriven parallel robots."
