abstract: >
  Multi-stage production systems concede for low error and failure margins
  within every single machining and assembly step to not degrade product quality.
  Especially during multi-stage production of rotating parts, minor defects during
  a single step can corrupt a workpiece beyond repair. Since multistage production
  systems are complex, inter-connected chains of machining steps, a global approach
  to handling and compensating error emergence and propagation is for reaching Zero-Defect
  Manufacturing indispensable. We introduce Part Variation Modeling within a knowledge
  capturing platform to monitor centrally gathered metrological data for deviations.
  Further, a parametric model is presented allowing for description of rotating parts
  and enabling identification of deviations at every stage. Based on our inter-stage
  correlation analysis technique, the parametric model enables description of Part
  Variation Modes of a piece given current machine states and historic deviation likelihood
  as will be presented.
