abstract: High dynamics of cable-driven parallel robots are beneficial to their use,
  however, the behavior of such robots during extreme maneuvers is yet to be investigated.
  In this paper, a simulation model is presented and validated in order to assess
  the emergency stop behavior of cable robots by simulation. Simulation results are
  evaluated using spectral analysis and validated against experimental data of a medium-sized
  redundantly restrained cable robot. The correctness and limitations of the model's
  accuracy in a range of the actual system's dynamics are furthermore shown.
