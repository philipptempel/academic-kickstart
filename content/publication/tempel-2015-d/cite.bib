 abstract = {This paper covers the kinematics and dynamics modelling ofthe mechatronic model for a 6 DOF cable-driven parallel robot and derives a real-time capable simulation model for such robots. The governing equations of motion for the mobile platform are derived using Newton-Euler formalism, furthermore, the pulley kinematics ofthe winches and a linear spring-damper-based cable model.Once the equations of motion are derived, closed-form force distribution is implemented and simulation results of the real-time capable model for the cable-driven parallel robot IPAnema3 are presented. Given the real-time capability, the presented model can be used for hardware-in-the-loop simulation or controller design, but also for case studies of highly dynamic or large-scale robots.},
