abstract: In this paper, the kinematics and dynamics modeling of the mechatronic model
  for a 6 DOF cabledriven parallel robot are covered and a real-time capable simulation
  model for such robots is derived. The governing equations of motion of the mobile
  platform are acquired using Newton-Euler formalism, furthermore, the pulley kinematics
  of the winches and a spring-damper based cable model are introduced. Once the equations
  of motion are derived, closed-form force distribution is implemented and simulation
  results of the real-time capable model for the cable-driven parallel robot IPAnema
  3 is presented. Given the real-time capability, the established model can be used
  for hardware-in-the-loop simulation or controller design, but also for case studies
  of highly dynamic or large-scale robots.
