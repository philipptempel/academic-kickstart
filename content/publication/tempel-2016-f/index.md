abstract: "High dynamics of cable-driven parallel robots are beneficial to their use, however, the behavior of such robots during extreme maneuvers is yet to be investigated. In this paper, a simulation model is presented and validated in order to assess the emergency stop behavior of cable robots by simulation. Simulation results are evaluated using spectral analysis and validated against experimental data of a medium-sized redundantly restrained cable robot. The correctness and limitations of the model's accuracy in a range of the actual system's dynamics are furthermore shown."
