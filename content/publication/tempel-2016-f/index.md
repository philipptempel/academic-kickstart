abstract: >
  Having high payload capacity, cable-driven parallel robots can move over
  large workspaces at high dynamics enabling this technology to be used for tasks
  beyond the possibilities of conventional industrial robots. The forces required
  for motion are generated by winches and are applied to the end effector by means
  of cables. Elasticity and flexibility of those cables provides a lot of potential
  - for theory and practice. Understanding the predominant influence of the cable's
  dynamics on the movement of cable robots is a key challenge faced in this project.
