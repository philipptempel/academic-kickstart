 abstract = {Cultural heritage science envisages understanding of methods and techniques used by past painters and sculptors in creating their masterpieces of art. Existing devices for in situ and non-destructive, automated scanning are large and bulky and built around the assumption of a perfectly planar surface. We are developing a lightweight, portable robot for scanning of paintings, marbles, or statues while explicitly allowing for their out-of-plane surface. This paper presents the kinematic design and analysis of the wrench-feasible workspace of a cable-driven parallel robot capable of positioning an imaging device with three translational and two rotational degrees of freedom. At the end stand geometric parameters optimized for the application requirements allowing for pan and tilt of 70° each in total, making scanning of the spatial surface of art objects possible.},
