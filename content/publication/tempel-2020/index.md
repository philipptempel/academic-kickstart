abstract: >
  Cultural heritage science envisages understanding of methods and techniques
  used by past painters and sculptors in creating their masterpieces of art. Existing
  devices for in situ and non-destructive, automated scanning are large and bulky
  and built around the assumption of a perfectly planar surface. We are developing
  a lightweight, portable robot for scanning of paintings, marbles, or statues while
  explicitly allowing for their out-of-plane surface. This paper presents the kinematic
  design and analysis of the wrench-feasible workspace of a cable-driven parallel
  robot capable of positioning an imaging device with three translational and two
  rotational degrees of freedom. At the end stand geometric parameters optimized for
  the application requirements allowing for pan and tilt of 70° each in total, making
  scanning of the spatial surface of art objects possible.
