abstract: >
  Cable-driven parallel robots are a special kind of parallel mechanism which
  use cables instead of rigid prismatic actuators to control a single platform. This
  paper presents a modeling approach to replace the single platform by multiple platforms.
  With this approach, it is possible to perform unlimited rotation with cable robots
  end-effector by relatively positioning these multiple platforms. We show how this
  class of cable robots can be modeled as multibody system, where platforms are connected
  with linkages by using revolute joints. These linkages can be seen as coupling elements.
  For example, using a crankshaft as coupling element, cable robots can perform novel
  motions such as unlimited rotation. We find a generic approach describing such multi-platform
  cable robot systems, after which force distribution and workspace of a case study
  are analyzed. Finally, we find out that inclusion and total orientation workspace
  are nonempty, considering joint reaction forces and platform and linkage masses.
  Furthermore, our modeling approach can be used for spatial multi-platform cable
  robots with revolute joints.
