abstract: This paper covers the kinematics and dynamics modelling ofthe mechatronic
  model for a 6 DOF cable-driven parallel robot and derives a real-time capable simulation
  model for such robots. The governing equations of motion for the mobile platform
  are derived using Newton-Euler formalism, furthermore, the pulley kinematics ofthe
  winches and a linear spring-damper-based cable model.Once the equations of motion
  are derived, closed-form force distribution is implemented and simulation results
  of the real-time capable model for the cable-driven parallel robot IPAnema3 are
  presented. Given the real-time capability, the presented model can be used for hardware-in-the-loop
  simulation or controller design, but also for case studies of highly dynamic or
  large-scale robots.
