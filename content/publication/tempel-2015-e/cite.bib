 abstract = {In this paper, the kinematics and dynamics modeling of the mechatronic model for a 6 DOF cabledriven parallel robot are covered and a real-time capable simulation model for such robots is derived. The governing equations of motion of the mobile platform are acquired using Newton-Euler formalism, furthermore, the pulley kinematics of the winches and a spring-damper based cable model are introduced. Once the equations of motion are derived, closed-form force distribution is implemented and simulation results of the real-time capable model for the cable-driven parallel robot IPAnema 3 is presented. Given the real-time capability, the established model can be used for hardware-in-the-loop simulation or controller design, but also for case studies of highly dynamic or large-scale robots.},
