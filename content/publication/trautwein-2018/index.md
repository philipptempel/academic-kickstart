abstract: "In this paper, an approach to capture and visualize the impact of a geometrical adjustments of a cabledriven parallel robot is presented. This method combines the precision of an analytic description with the efficiency of numeric methods. The translational workspace of the robot, corresponding to a set of geometrical parameters, is determined by a piecewise assembly of boundary segments. The intersections of the curves, defining the workspace border, are computed by utilizing their shape as conic sections. Calculation examples are also given, comparing the impact of different parameter sets on the workspace."
