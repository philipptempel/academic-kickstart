abstract: In this paper, an approach to capture and visualize the impact of a geometrical
  adjustments of a cabledriven parallel robot is presented. This method combines the
  precision of an analytic description with the efficiency of numeric methods. The
  translational workspace of the robot, corresponding to a set of geometrical parameters,
  is determined by a piecewise assembly of boundary segments. The intersections of
  the curves, defining the workspace border, are computed by utilizing their shape
  as conic sections. Calculation examples are also given, comparing the impact of
  different parameter sets on the workspace.
