abstract: Kinematics and dynamics of cable-driven parallel robots are affected by
  the cables used as force and motion transmitting elements. Flexural rigidity of
  these cables is of major interest to better understand dynamics of these systems
  and to improve their accuracy. The approach for modeling spatial cable dynamics,
  as presented in this paper, is based on the modified rigid-finite element method
  using rigid bodies and springdamper elements. With this, a simulation of a planar
  3 degrees of freedom cable-driven parallel robot is constructed as a multi-body
  dynamics model. Under consideration of holonomic constraints and Baumgarte stabilization,
  a simulation framework for the simulation of cable-driven parallel robots including
  dynamics of the cables is developed and presented.
