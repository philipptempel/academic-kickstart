abstract: >
  Model based open-loop and closed-loop control systems make use of the system's
  inertial parameters. Unfortunately, not all of these values can be determined analytically
  nor can they be obtained from simple measurements. Established experiments for inertial
  parameters estimation have been applied to serial and parallel rigid-link manipulators,
  yet in very few cases to cable-driven parallel robots. Due to their kinematic properties
  and their unique setup, cable robots are more sensitive to incorrect estimates of
  the inertial parameters making it important to obtain such quantities through experiments.
  In this work, we assess the topic of inertial parameter identification of a parallel
  flexible-link manipulator exemplified by the suspended cable-driven parallel robot
  CoGiRo. Identification equations are derived from Newton-Euler equations of motion
  of an arbitrary point fixed to a rigid-body. Laboratory experiments for identification
  of the inertial parameters are then introduced and results are presented. Within
  the limitations of the sensors and data acquisition methods, reasonable results
  have been obtained, thereby validating the procedure for suspended cable-driven parallel
  robots.
