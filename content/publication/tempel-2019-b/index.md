abstract: Cable-driven parallel robots use elastic-flexible cables for operation due
  to their advantages over rigid-link joints. In state-of-the-art modeling of cable-driven
  parallel robots, cables are mostly kinematics based and contain no explicit consideration
  of their dynamics. Experimental observations show these simplifications do not hold
  true in various scenarios where the cable-driven parallel robot becomes uncontrollable.
  We revisit the kinematics-based cable models and present a cable model empowering
  Cosserat rod theory for which the deflected configuration is formulated through
  higher-order Bézier curves. Numerical time integration of the dynamics is performed
  using an energy-momentum conserving integration scheme. The applicability of our
  cable model is exemplified on a planar cable robot with 3 degrees of freedom.
