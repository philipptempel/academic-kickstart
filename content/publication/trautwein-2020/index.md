abstract: >
  Due to their use of modular components, cable-driven parallel robots are
  prime candidates for use as reconfigurable robotic manipulators. Reconfiguration
  comprises both the change of the geometry as well as topological changes such as
  adding or removing axes. To validate practicability of methods for reconfiguration,
  we developed the reconfigurable cable-driven parallel robot Cable-Operated Parallel
  Robot (COPacabana). This paper presents the mechanical design as well as the hardware
  and software in use on the test rig. Further use cases for validation of research
  findings are presented as well.
