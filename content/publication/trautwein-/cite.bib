 abstract = {Due to their use of modular components, cable-driven parallel robots are prime candidates for use as reconfigurable robotic manipulators. Reconfiguration comprises both the change of the geometry as well as topological changes such as adding or removing axes. To validate practicability of methods for reconfiguration, we developed the reconfigurable cable-driven parallel robot Cable-Operated Parallel Robot (COPacabana). This paper presents the mechanical design as well as the hardware and software in use on the test rig. Further use cases for validation of research findings are presented as well.},
